        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm a software engineer in the making, studying at Reykjavík University. I have a lot of passion towards design and frontend development as well as software architecture. 
            I take a lot of inspiration from video games as it relates to UI and UX as games that prioritize these aspects tend to be successful.</p>
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>Through my short programming career I've mainly studied Python and C#, however since starting my studies at Reykjavík University I've come to learn and use Docker, JS, CSS, HTML, SQL and more. 
            Currently, I'm emphasizing HTML, CSS and a sprinkle of JS to further my frontend development skills. Not only do I think they are crucial in today's designer intensive landscape, but also as previously mentioned I'm a great proponent of solid UI/UX.</p>

        <h2>JobHub</h2>
        <p>While I haven't done a lot of larger scale projects, a recent one I worked on revolved around designing a website. This website was for a fictional job offering company no dissimilar from <a>Alfreð</a> or <a>LinkedIn</a>. 
            This project was a group project where I oversaw, designed and coded most of the visuals for the website, as well as implemented a lot of the Django forms used in the project. </p>
        <h2>Tech stack</h2>
        <p>This project mainly involved usage of the Django Framework, as well as HTML, CSS and some JS.</p>
